    "Q1. What is a contingency matrix, and how is it used to evaluate the performance of a classification model?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. A contingency matrix, also known as a confusion matrix, is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. It compares the actual values of the target variable with the predicted values by the model. The matrix has rows representing the actual classes and columns representing the predicted classes. Each cell in the matrix represents the number of instances that belong to a particular combination of actual and predicted classes. It allows for easy visualization of the model's performance in terms of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives."

    "Q2. How is a pair confusion matrix different from a regular confusion matrix, and why might it be useful in certain situations?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. A pair confusion matrix is a variation of the confusion matrix that is used when dealing with binary classification problems where there is interest in understanding the performance of the model on specific pairs of classes. It is different from a regular confusion matrix in that it focuses only on a subset of classes, typically two, and provides detailed information about the model's performance regarding those classes. It might be useful in situations where certain class pairs are of particular interest, such as in medical diagnosis where correctly identifying certain diseases might be more critical than others."

    "Q3. What is an extrinsic measure in the context of natural language processing, and how is it typically used to evaluate the performance of language models?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. An extrinsic measure in the context of natural language processing (NLP) is a metric used to evaluate the performance of language models based on their performance in downstream tasks. These tasks could include sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, machine translation, etc. Extrinsic measures assess how well the language model's output contributes to the overall performance of the task it's being applied to."

    "Q4. What is an intrinsic measure in the context of machine learning, and how does it differ from an extrinsic measure?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. In machine learning, an intrinsic measure is a metric used to evaluate the performance of a model based on its internal characteristics, such as its ability to learn from data, generalization capability, complexity, etc. Unlike extrinsic measures, which assess the model's performance on specific tasks, intrinsic measures focus on the model itself and do not rely on external evaluation tasks.\n",

    "Q5. What is the purpose of a confusion matrix in machine learning, and how can it be used to identify strengths and weaknesses of a model?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. The purpose of a confusion matrix in machine learning is to provide a detailed breakdown of the performance of a classification model. It allows for the identification of strengths and weaknesses by showing the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives for each class. By analyzing the confusion matrix, one can identify which classes the model is performing well on and which classes it is struggling with, thus guiding further model improvement efforts."

    "\n",
    "Ans. Common intrinsic measures used to evaluate the performance of unsupervised learning algorithms include metrics such as silhouette score, Davies–Bouldin index, and Calinski-Harabasz index. These metrics assess properties such as cluster cohesion, separation, and compactness. A higher silhouette score indicates better-defined clusters, while lower Davies–Bouldin and Calinski-Harabasz scores suggest better cluster quality."

    "Q7. What are some limitations of using accuracy as a sole evaluation metric for classification tasks, and how can these limitations be addressed?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Limitations of using accuracy as a sole evaluation metric for classification tasks include its inability to handle class imbalance, its sensitivity to misclassification costs, and its failure to provide insights into the types of errors made by the model. These limitations can be addressed by using alternative evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC), or using techniques like stratified sampling, cost-sensitive learning, or using different evaluation strategies like cross-validation."
